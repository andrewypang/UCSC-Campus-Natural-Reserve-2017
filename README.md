# UCSC-Campus-Natural-Reserve-2017

The UC Santa Cruz Campus Natural Reserve covers 410 acres of protected natural lands on the UC Santa Cruz campus. This land was set aside as part of the UCSC Long Range Development Plan to preserve the natural communities for teaching, field research and natural history interpretation. These lands are an outdoor classroom and living library and laboratory.

In 2017, I had two internships at the UC Santa Cruz Campus Natural Reserve.
